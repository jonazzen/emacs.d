# emacs.d

My personal GNU Emacs configuration. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Installation

To install my GNU Emacs configuration just clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d` just make sure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonazzen/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

## FYI

Since i'm too lazy to commit and push to github every time i make some changes to the code(I'm still learning Emacs Lisp).
I have made it commit and push automatically when i close GNU Emacs.
